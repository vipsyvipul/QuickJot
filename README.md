## FAQs

#### Q. Does it sync between devices and browsers?
No. Your jots will be stored locally in the browser where the extension is installed.

#### Q. Does that mean my jots will be deleted if I change my browser or device?
Unfortunately, yes.

#### Q. Then where's the value in installing this extension?!
QuickJot was created to jot down quick thoughts or meeting notes. It's not a replacement of any note taking app. It's a blank sheet of reusable paper. If there is any jot that you would like to preserve forever, just copy paste that jot in your preferred app.

#### Q. Hmmm. What jots can I take?
Sky is the limit.

- Grocery list
- Jokes
- Puns

- ... anything that can be jotted. Jot it!
